  <main>
    <p>Arsenal Football Club, 
      commonly referred to as Arsenal, 
      is a professional football club based in Islington, 
      London, England. Founded in 1886, Arsenal has a rich history and is one of the most successful clubs in 
      English football. The club competes in the 
      Premier League, the top tier of English football.</p>
    <p>Arsenal is known for its attractive style of play, often characterized by possesion-based football and attacking football.
      They are also known for their strong and stable defence which is regarded as the best defencee in the world.</p>
    <p>Over the years, Arsenal has won numerous domestic and international trophies, including 13 league titles and 14 FA Cups,
      making them one of the most successful clubs in English football history. The club has a passionate fan base and a strong rivalry with North London neighbours Tottenham Hotspur,
      known as the North London Derby.</p> 

      <h2>Arsenal Success in the Last 3 years</h2>
      <p>In recent years, Arsenal has been a strong and solid team, they rose up from the shambles of the previous 2021/22 season.
        The immediate success came in the 2022/23 season, where they finished 2nd place in the Premier League, their highest finish since the 2015/16 season.
        Signings like Gabriel Jesus, Oleksandr Zinchenko and Fabio Vieira played crucial roles in Arsenal's resurgence.
      </p>
      <p>In the 2022/2023 season, the English Premier League saw a new Arsenal, not an Arsenal struggling to finish top four,
        but an Arsenal challenging for the title. They were in a close race with Manchester City for the entire season,
        ultimately finishing second, just five points behind the champions. This marked a significant improvement from previous seasons and signaled Arsenal's return to title contention.
      </p>
      <p>The next season, 2023/2024, Arsenal came again with another challenge, they signed Europa Conference winner Declan Rice for
        record fee of £100M, David Raya, an amazing goalkeeper, from Brentford, Kai Havertz from Chelsea, and Jurrien Timber from Ajax.
        These signings helped Arsenal push for an even stronger title challenge in which they were so close to winnning the Premier League trophy,
        but fell short on the final day of the competition, making them place second with just two points behind 
        Manchester City again. This was devastating for the club and its fans.</p>
      <p>The 2024/2025 season comes and Arsenal want to win the title again. They signed Euro Winner Mikel Merino and world-class 
        left back/ centre back, Riccardo Calafiori. With these signings, Arsenal were determined to go one step further and win the Premier League title in the 2024/2025 season.
        This season, Manchester City were held back by injuries and poor, inconsistent form, but Arsenal faced a new challenge, new manager
        Arne Slot's Liverpool. It was a pretty dominant season for Liverpool as Arsenal weren't at their best throughout the campaign.
        In the end, Liverpool finished first after being in first place the whole of the campaign, Arsenal second place yet again, and Manchester City  surprisingly third
        after a horrific season.</p>
        <p>The 2025/2026 season looks like Arsenal's strongest attempt yet and are pushing after making 7 summer signings. <b>Will they win the league
          this season? Only time will tell.</b>
